1. Host the bot remotely so that it runs 24/7.
2. Add a way for mods to automatically add pics to the bot, something like !pic <attached pic>, the bot then downloads the pic into its 'database'.
3. In parallel with 2., reorganise the way images are stored. Maybe fetch them remotely? Or just take the easy way out and use an image host like imgur.com?
4. Implement a cooldown feature so that the bot doesn't post goodnight more than 5 times in the space of 10 minutes, say.
5. Refactor the bot to work with multiple servers
